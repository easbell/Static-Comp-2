## Project title
Static Comp #2

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to replicate a given comp layout to enhance HTML and CSS skills. This was a great way to utilize and strengthen my grid skills. Given the complexity of the layout, I learned a lot throughout the process. Below are screenshots of both my project and the given comp.

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS

## Wishlist
If given more time I would have liked to make the sidebar and graph areas collapsible.
